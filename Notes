How I got Output Gap?
First I got the absolute quarterly GDP for the time period [Office for National Statistics]:

I got the yearly output gap [Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)]
https://obr.uk/public-finances-databank-2024-25/

Using the quarterly estimates developed [OBR: Output gap measurement: judgement and uncertainty] I replicated the shape of the quarterly output gaps in %.
